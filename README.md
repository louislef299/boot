# boot

This is a cli tool written in swift that manages a boot folder and
boot capailities. More on what it is and how it works are to come, but
for now, this is just a way to get my hands dirty with swift.

Where will this project go? How many features will I include in it?
Not sure, but I'm going to start small here and work out.
